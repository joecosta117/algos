//Underscorify Substring
//takes in a string and substring.
//returns version of string with every instance of substring wrapped
//in underscores. if two substrings overlap each other, then underscores should
//only appear on the left and right of the combined substrings.
//if there are no substrings, return the original string
//ex: underscorify("testthis is a testtest to see if testestest works")
//expected: "_test_this is a _testtest_ to see if _testestest_ works"
